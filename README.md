# Grimoire

Smart Contracts for warlocks &amp; witches of the chain. Only those who know all the dangers about this kind of magic should use these. It's owner hasn't tested if any of these contracts will randomly summon creatures of the dark forest.

- Designed for Solidity >= 0.8.7.
- Made with custom errors instead of revert strings.
- Not necessarily made with readability in mind, but well documented through Natspec.
